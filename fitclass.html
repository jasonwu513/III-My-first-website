					<p>1.1 為什麼會胖?</p>
				</div>

					<p>
					引言:
					人們肥胖的通常原因是他們吃太多或運動太少 (通常是吃太多也動太少...)。根據 物質守恆 and 熱力學能量不滅。放入系統的能量(吃進身體的食物熱量) ,減去取出的能量(維持生命+運動+屎拉出去+尿尿出去+流汗... 等損失的熱量) 剩餘的能量必部會消失，即為脂肪！儘管如此，有些人就是吃不胖,有些人則是喝水也會胖,下面我們開始討論肥胖的可能原因。
					</p>
					<p>1.
					基因影響:據調查，有些人會胖，是因為他們從父母那裡繼承了“胖基因”。毫無疑問，人們的遺傳基因有所不同，例如父母身高是高的那麼小孩子長高的機會也較大
					然而，身高也受到飲食文化的影響。肥胖的人往往來自肥胖的家庭。肥胖的原因可能來自於基因遺傳。但也有可能是他們從他們的父母那裡學到飲食習慣。
					肯定的是，確實有一到數個肥胖基因影響著我們。但並不表示有這樣基因的人注定要變胖,與其和他人比較,不如與自己比較。<br>
					我曾經認識一個四十多歲的婦人,她有兩個兄弟，每個兄弟都重四百磅,照理來說她應該是胖的，但是她身材苗挑。她有一個長大的孩子，重三百五十磅。很明顯，她很可能有肥胖的基因。所以，我有一天問她：“你怎麼不胖？”她解釋說，她認為這與她去健身房前每天跑了一個半小時​​的事實有關,我們沒辦法決定我們的基因,但我們能控制我們的生活習慣,從長遠來看，身體活動對保持適當的體重有至關重要的作用.
					<br>
					<a href="https://www.top1health.com/Article/25412">參考資料:肥胖基因：「OB」、「LEPR」、「FTO」...</a>
					</p>
					<p>

。
					</p>

					<p>工作型態改變:現代生活工作內容的改變也是造成肥胖的主因之一,工業革命（英語：Industrial Revolution），又稱產業革命，更準確的說是第一次工業革命，一個起點約於1760年代，一直持續到1830年代至1840年代的歷史時期。在這段時間裡，人類生產逐漸轉向新的製造過程，出現了以機器取代人力、獸力的趨勢，以大規模的工廠生產取代個體工場手工生產的一場生產與科技革命。由於機器的發明及運用成為了這個時代的標誌,英國人瓦特改良蒸汽機之後,瓦特改良蒸汽機之前，整個生產所需動力依靠人力，畜力，水力和風力。伴隨蒸汽機的發明和改進，工廠不再依河或溪流而建，很多以前依賴人力與手工完成的工作，自蒸汽機發明後被機械化生產取代。工業革命是一般政治革命不可比擬的巨大變革，與10000年前農業革命一般，革命其影響涉及人類社會生活的各個方面，使社會發生了巨大的變革，對人類的現代化進程推動起到不可替代的作用，把人們推向了一個嶄新的「蒸汽時代
					在瓦特改良蒸汽機之前，整個生產所需動力依靠人力，畜力，水力和風力。伴隨蒸汽機的發明和改進，很多以前依賴人力與手工完成的工作，自蒸汽機發明後被機械化生產取代。工業革命是一般政治革命不可比擬的巨大變革，與10000年前農業革命一般，革命其影響涉及人類社會生活的各個方面，使社會發生了巨大的變革，對人類的現代化進程推動起到不可替代的作用，把人們推向了一個嶄新的「蒸汽時代」。過去人們交通方式主要透過雙腳行走,如今已被大量的機械化交通工具取代,人們的工作從勞力密集的工作,逐漸轉向知識密集和服務等產業,每日所消耗的熱量大幅下降,然而吃下去的食物並沒有減少,事實上隨著經濟的發展,人們吃下了更多高熱量的食物,熱量輸入增加 和輸出減少,也是造成肥胖率提升的原因</p>
					<p>心理因素 壓力大
					</p>

					<p>睡眠不足: <br>
						我認識熬夜的瘦子還是很多,熬夜的胖子我只認識我一個,但不可否認,熬夜的時候總是會想要吃點消夜
					</p>
					<p>飲食:農作畜牧技術不斷改量, 食物可以低廉的成本取得,糖類的大量使用不足夠的蛋白質和/或飲食中的太多脂肪和/或飲食中太多的碳水化合物和/
					</p>
					<p>運動:
					</p>
					<p>年齡:
					</p>

					<p>
					腸道細菌。身體裡有許多人類細胞;而是許多細菌在我們每個人中居住的十倍，特別是在我們的腸子。這些細菌群落從一個人到另一個人不同
					下一個。他們幫助我們消化我們的食物，有些人比其他人更有效率。因此，有些人給予相同數量的食物，比其他人吸收更多的熱量。所以，一個特定的人真的可以吃得很少，少一些
					比其他人還要重，
					</p>

					<p>基礎代謝:

					</p>

				 	<p>
						新陳代謝指的是我們體內大腦、荷爾蒙、腸道以及脂肪細胞中訊息傳遞物質的組合，它可調節卡路里的燃燒速度。而大部分的肥胖症多數伴隨新陳代謝機能失調，而新陳代謝機能長期失調也會導致肥胖，所以肥胖症和新陳代謝症候群是就像孿生兄弟一樣。

新陳代謝症候群是罹患慢性疾病的元凶，根據衛生署資料統計全國十大死因中有四項和新陳代謝症候群有關，如：心臟病、高血壓、中風、糖尿病等。

而所謂的新陳代謝率（BMR），指的就是一天的總代謝率，包括基礎代謝、運動、進食等所消耗的熱量，亦即在安靜的狀態下消耗的最低熱量。這些能量主要用於保持各器官的機能，基礎代謝率會隨著年齡增加或體重減輕而降低。

一般來說，小孩的基礎代謝率高於成人，而年紀越大基礎代謝率也會慢慢降低，這是因為在發育期的年輕人，心臟、胃腸等內臟器官的活力充沛，身體需要很大的能量，能量消耗也隨之增高。

基礎代謝率會在十八歲的時候上升到一個高峰期，過了二十五歲以後，基礎代謝率就會逐漸下降，尤其到四十歲以後，因為的雌激素減少會使得新陳代謝率下降得更明顯，這就是為什麼女人過四十歲以後即使吃得少也很容易發胖。而雌激素和脂肪代謝有很大的關係，若雌激素減少，就容易堆積脂肪。

					<p>1. Endocrine systems </p>
					<p>The most common is the metabolic syndrome, such as high levels of insulin in the body, blood fat metabolism disorders (high levels of triglycerides and good cholesterol decreased), high uric acid, high blood pressure and high blood sugar, and menstrual
						disorders or infertility The phenomenon appears. The so-called metabolic syndrome refers to metabolic-related risk factors, they contain five items:
					</p>
					<p>1. Male waist ≧ 90cm; female waist ≧ 80cm
					</p>
					<p>2. Increased blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≧ 130mmHg / diastolic blood pressure ≧ 85mmHg
					</p>
					<p>3. Fasting blood glucose increased ≧ 110mg / dl
					</p>
					<p>4. triglycerides increased ≧ 150mg / dl
					</p>
					<p>5. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): male
						<40mg / dl; women <50mg / dl. As long as there are three of the above three risk factors known as metabolic syndrome. Obese adipose tissue, easy to cause the pancreas to increase the secretion of insulin, long-term secretion of a large number of results
						  easily lead to increased insulin resistance and pancreatic failure, will increase blood sugar. </p>
							<p>2. Cardiovascular disease
							</p>
							<p>(1) Hypertension (2) Coronary artery disease (3) Fat metabolic abnormalities (4) Cerebrovascular and vascular embolism. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes easily lead to atherosclerosis and increased the risk of stroke. And obese people are also
								prone to lower extremity venous thrombosis and even lead to pulmonary and cerebral vascular embolism.
							</p>
							<p>3. Respiratory system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obesity easy complicated with obesity ventilated syndrome, obstructive sleep syndrome. Due to abdominal fat and more so that the diaphragm increases, will oppress the lungs and easily lead to the phenomenon of lack of ventilation, but also more
								prone to night sleep apnea syndrome.
							</p>
							<p>4. Digestive system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people not only gallstones increased, but also prone to acute cholecystitis, and obesity caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver may cause hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function, hepatitis, and even lead to cirrhosis; because of obesity caused
								by high cholesterol Blood, through the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract to the digestive tract discharge process, will make the digestive system diseases, such as cirrhosis, fatty liver and gallstones, etc., often accompanied by gastric acid
								reflux and make the esophagus damaged and degeneration.
							</p>
							<p>5. Joint disease aspects
							</p>
							<p>Weight heavier, the joints required to bear the weight of the larger, easy to make joint aging, and get degenerative arthritis, especially the knee is particularly vulnerable to, and concurrent degenerative arthritis of various joint lesions.
							</p>
							<p>6.Reproductive system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese women infertility than the average female than three percent, because too much fat will affect the secretion of hormones and ovarian ovarian function changes, and make menstrual disorders, leading to infertility. They are also more susceptible
								to ovarian polycystic disease. Obesity also affects sexual function.
							</p>
							<p>7. Skin diseases
							</p>
							<p>Obese people often in the neck, armpits, genitals and stocks and other skin folds occur at the rash, causing red itchy eczema. Another venous blood flow slow down the block, but also easily lead to varicose veins and dermatitis.
							</p>
							<p>8. Mental illness aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people are prone to inferiority complex, lack of self-confidence and other psychological barriers, and even cause depression.
							</p>
							<p>9. Cancer aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people with colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer have a higher chance.
