					<p>3.1 Sports and Fit</p>
				</div>

				<div id="box1_1" class="boxp">
					<p>The usual reason given for people getting fat is that they eat too much and/or exercise too little. That reflects one of the basic laws of thermodynamics—I forget which one. The amount of energy you put into a system minus the energy you take out
						has to be stored somewhere i.e. FAT! This formulation—true though it is—does not entirely explain obesity since some people seem to eat more than fat people and exercise no more than these same fat people, and yet they are not fat! Chalking this
						fact up to the general perversity of the universe is not sufficient explanation. Other factors must come into play. I mention below some of the ideas thoughtful people have proposed to explain why fat people become fat:
					</p>
					<p>1. It is thought that some people are destined to gain weight because they have inherited “fat genes” from their parents. There can be no doubt that people vary in their genetic makeup and some people are inclined because of genetic reasons to become
						tall, or broad-shouldered or squat or fat. It is known, for instance that height is controlled by a number of different genes, probably around twenty. Nevertheless, height is affected also by diet. Fat people tend to come from fat families. That
						doesn’t necessarily mean that they are fat for genetic reasons. They could have learned fat-making behaviors, i.e. eating habits, from their parents when they were growing up. Because of studies of identical twins separated at birth, however, it
						can be said, certainly, that there is, indeed, a strong genetic component to body weight. This is not to say that someone so constructed genetically is doomed to becoming fat.
					</p>
					<p>I once saw a woman in her mid- forties who should have been fat, but wasn’t. She had two brothers, each of whom weighed over four hundred pounds; and she had a grown child who weighed over three hundred and fifty pounds. Plainly, she had whatever
						genes it took to get fat. So, I asked her one day, “How come you’re not fat?” She explained that she thought it had to do with the fact that she ran for an hour and a half every day before she went to the gym.
					</p>
					<p>2. Diet. Remember that law of thermodynamics. The amount of energy that goes into a machine (the human body, for instance) has to balance the amount that goes out; or the extra energy that goes in (food) has to be stored somehow (fat.) So, for everyone,
						no matter what that person’s genetic vulnerability, either lowering the food intake or increasing the energy output (exercise) will lower the energy stored as fat. Eating less and less or exercising more and more will cause weight loss. Our modern
						diet seems to be designed to pack as many calories as possible within the human capacity to eat. High caloric foods seem to be inherently more attractive than other foods for reasons that probably have to do with survival in conditions that human
						beings found themselves in most of the time throughout our history. But no longer.
					</p>
					<p>Some examples: Chinese who lived in China subsisted on a relatively calorie poor diet and were, for the most part, thin and healthy. Their children, once they came to this country and began eating like the rest of the Americans, became fat in higher
						numbers and began developing all those illnesses associated with obesity.
					</p>
					<p>There is an Indian tribe that lives in an arid part of the West and has lived there for many generations. (Apparently their land was so unproductive; none of the other tribes were inclined to go to war to evict them.) They survived very well on a
						very low-calorie diet. When the white men came, however, bringing their accustomed diet with them, the Indians became fat. Now over 90% of them are very fat and approximately the same number suffer from diabetes. They had evolved over many generations
						to live on a sparse diet. Probably the rest of us are similarly not quite evolved enough to cope with our modern diet.
					</p>
					<p>3. Exercise is relevant. A lack of exercise causes obesity; and we are getting better and better at not getting enough exercise, There are exceptions. A whole lot of people are running around, literally, or playing sports, including group sports,
						at an advanced age. This never used to happen. When I was a kid, if I saw someone running through the streets of Manhattan, I knew they were running for a bus. In particular, it is socially acceptable now for women to play sports throughout their
						lives. So, there are a minority who are very active physically. But a greater number are less active than people used to be. Television usually gets blamed. Before that there was radio. When telephones first came in, most people thought the device
						would never catch on. If they wanted to talk to someone, they said, they could just walk over to that person’s house. Nowadays, if people really have to go somewhere, they drive rather than walk, use an elevator rather than climb stairs and are,
						in general, passive rather than active.
					</p>
					<p>Over the long run, physical activity has an effect on maintaining proper weight that is at least as important as a proper diet.
					</p>
					<p>4. Improper eating habits, learned while growing up, are thought to contribute to excessive weight gain over the course of a life time. The problem is there is no agreement about what constitutes proper or improper eating habits.
					</p>
					<p>Finishing eating everything on your plate used to be considered good; now it is considered bad. You should stop eating when you are no longer hungry. Do not eat that last potato just because it is sitting there on your plate. It is often recommended
						to dieters that they get in the habit of purposely leaving some food uneaten on their plates.
					</p>
					<p>5. Another reason given for gaining weight is too much TV. The amount of time children watch television has been shown to correlate with weight; the more they watch, the heavier they get. Possibly the effect is through a lack of exercise. Someone
						sitting inert on a couch is not outside playing ball. Or, perhaps, the food commercials on television that are designed to make people hungry actually do make them hungry.
					</p>
					<p>4. Lack of sleep. People who sleep less eat more. Maybe they have nothing better to do. Maybe there are chemical changes that take place in the brain to compensate for inadequate sleep. There is an appetite center in the brain, and it is known to
						be affected by circumstances, including, possibly, sleep deprivation. (The appetite center in the brain is close to the area that controls sex—which should say something; but I don’t know what.)
					</p>
					<p>5. Certain drugs. Some of the anti-depressants, for example, cause weight gain. Over the years I have converted a few chronically depressed, thin women into chubby, but cheery middle-aged women, (although they are not cheery about being chubby.)
						There are a number of other drugs that act similarly.
					</p>
					<p>6. The sun-spot cycle. As far as I know, there is no correlation between sun-spots and weight gain. I mention this here only to keep the reader’s attention.
					</p>
					<p>7. Poverty. Poverty correlates with obesity. There are probably two reasons: there is little access in the inner-city to fresh fruit and vegetables. Processed foods are more fattening. Secondly, healthy foods are more expensive, so, in poor communities,
						a culture of eating fried foods and other fattening foods has grown up.
					</p>
					<p>8. Certain hormones. The usual “glandular conditions” that are mentioned often by lay people as an explanation for obesity include low thyroid and high cortisone levels. The effects they produce on weight, however, are relatively minor and inconsistent.
						There are other hormones, however, secreted in the stomach that are known to affect appetite one way or another. Strategies are being developed to control weight using them; but the results so far have been disappointing. The stomach bypass operations
						that are used currently to treat morbid obesity are known to affect these hormones, and it may be partially through that mechanism that these operations work.
					</p>
					<p>9. The bacteria that live in the intestine. There are a great many human cells in the body; but ten times that many bacteria take up residence in each of us, particularly in our intestines. These communities of bacteria vary from one person to the
						next. They help us to digest our food, and some are more efficient at that task than others. Therefore, some people, given the same amount of food, absorb more calories than others. So, it is true that a particular person can eat very little, less
						than other people, and still gain weight.
					</p>
					<p>A study was conducted in which a number of people ate the same number of calories and exercised to the same extent; yet there was a perceptible difference in the change of weight each person experienced! There are only three possible reasons why
						this could happen: for some reason, some people are better at absorbing the calories from their food than others, perhaps because of those bacteria which assist digestion. Secondly, some people are more active when they are resting (not exercising)
						than others. Probably both of these explanations are true. The third reason, an innate difference in metabolism, may result in a somewhat higher body temperature; but the mechanism of this higher metabolism may still come down to moving imperceptibly
						more than other people.
					</p>
					<p>10. Bacteria affect weight in a second way: they seem to affect the hormones that the stomach secretes to regulate weight. A common cold virus, adenovirus-36, has been linked to obesity, perhaps because it affects the number of fat cells in the body.
					</p>
					<p>11. The greater availability of food. Over the last 50 years, changing agricultural policies have encouraged more planting of food which then becomes more available. When food becomes cheaper, people eat more. Sugar may be especially important. Some
						people date the obesity epidemic to the widespread availability of sugar.
					</p>
					<p>12. It seems that college students gain an average of one to three pounds during their freshman year. Similarly, men gain a few pounds the first year after they marry. A strategy for avoiding weight gain immediately suggests itself: don’t go to college
						and don’t marry.
					</p>
					<p>Also: Obesity has been linked to: stress and/or not enough protein in the diet and/or too much fat in the diet and/or too much carbohydrate in the diet and/or an overly warm house and/or too much light (not enough light causes depression) and/or
						pollution etc.
					</p>
					<p>It is evident that there are many causes of obesity. They overlap with each other. Perhaps there is a genetic predisposition to have a particular community of intestinal bacteria; and that might in turn affect those hormones that control appetite
						in a particular way. Recent evidence suggests that exercise changes the effect of the “fat genes.” The inclination to exercise itself might be controlled genetically. What matters, I think, is the fact that excessive weight is not simply a failure
						of will power. It is not a moral failing. Dieting has to be approached in a practical way and not with finger wagging. (Excerpted from “The Stuff Yourself Diet” © Fredric Neuman and Warren Goodman.) Follow Dr. Neuman's blog at fredricneumanmd.com/blog

					<p>1. Endocrine systems </p>
					<p>The most common is the metabolic syndrome, such as high levels of insulin in the body, blood fat metabolism disorders (high levels of triglycerides and good cholesterol decreased), high uric acid, high blood pressure and high blood sugar, and menstrual
						disorders or infertility The phenomenon appears. The so-called metabolic syndrome refers to metabolic-related risk factors, they contain five items:
					</p>
					<p>1. Male waist ≧ 90cm; female waist ≧ 80cm
					</p>
					<p>2. Increased blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≧ 130mmHg / diastolic blood pressure ≧ 85mmHg
					</p>
					<p>3. Fasting blood glucose increased ≧ 110mg / dl
					</p>
					<p>4. triglycerides increased ≧ 150mg / dl
					</p>
					<p>5. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): male
						<40mg / dl; women <50mg / dl. As long as there are three of the above three risk factors known as metabolic syndrome. Obese adipose tissue, easy to cause the pancreas to increase the secretion of insulin, long-term secretion of a large number of results
						  easily lead to increased insulin resistance and pancreatic failure, will increase blood sugar. </p>
							<p>2. Cardiovascular disease
							</p>
							<p>(1) Hypertension (2) Coronary artery disease (3) Fat metabolic abnormalities (4) Cerebrovascular and vascular embolism. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes easily lead to atherosclerosis and increased the risk of stroke. And obese people are also
								prone to lower extremity venous thrombosis and even lead to pulmonary and cerebral vascular embolism.
							</p>
							<p>3. Respiratory system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obesity easy complicated with obesity ventilated syndrome, obstructive sleep syndrome. Due to abdominal fat and more so that the diaphragm increases, will oppress the lungs and easily lead to the phenomenon of lack of ventilation, but also more
								prone to night sleep apnea syndrome.
							</p>
							<p>4. Digestive system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people not only gallstones increased, but also prone to acute cholecystitis, and obesity caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver may cause hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function, hepatitis, and even lead to cirrhosis; because of obesity caused
								by high cholesterol Blood, through the liver, gallbladder, biliary tract to the digestive tract discharge process, will make the digestive system diseases, such as cirrhosis, fatty liver and gallstones, etc., often accompanied by gastric acid
								reflux and make the esophagus damaged and degeneration.
							</p>
							<p>5. Joint disease aspects
							</p>
							<p>Weight heavier, the joints required to bear the weight of the larger, easy to make joint aging, and get degenerative arthritis, especially the knee is particularly vulnerable to, and concurrent degenerative arthritis of various joint lesions.
							</p>
							<p>6.Reproductive system aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese women infertility than the average female than three percent, because too much fat will affect the secretion of hormones and ovarian ovarian function changes, and make menstrual disorders, leading to infertility. They are also more susceptible
								to ovarian polycystic disease. Obesity also affects sexual function.
							</p>
							<p>7. Skin diseases
							</p>
							<p>Obese people often in the neck, armpits, genitals and stocks and other skin folds occur at the rash, causing red itchy eczema. Another venous blood flow slow down the block, but also easily lead to varicose veins and dermatitis.
							</p>
							<p>8. Mental illness aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people are prone to inferiority complex, lack of self-confidence and other psychological barriers, and even cause depression.
							</p>
							<p>9. Cancer aspects
							</p>
							<p>Obese people with colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, gallbladder cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer have a higher chance.

					</p>
					<p>2. drink plenty of water, drink only water, do not drink Many people will drink water to lose weight method This is a good way I often lose weight with weight loss Drinking water can increase metabolism to speed up the discharge of waste It is not
						easy to accumulate harmful to humans and can make gastrointestinal motility normal constipation Drink 2,000cc to 3000cc a day the most appropriate Like my own will usually be prepared kettle kettle must have a scale So as to know how much they drink

					</p>
					<p>3. learn to picky eaters Weight loss in the picky eaters are not bad habits yo we can not misunderstand (laughs) The following is a copy of the network from the network to help you sort out several picky eaters "Special pick" light food such as hot
						vegetables Boiled, burnt, baked, cold or steamed peeled lean meat, fish, seafood Try not to use fried, fried or thicken cooking methods to prevent excessive calorie intake "Less pick" a meat, eat a bowl of food will not have the feeling of eating,
						Can also increase dietary fiber and other nutrients intake. "Must pick" grains mixed rice fine rice, Grains of rice grains with more cellulose, more likely to have satiety; Its nutrient content is also more fine and balanced rice. "More pick" vegetables
						and fruits instead of weekdays snacks, When the afternoon office or watching TV when greedy, May wish to small cucumber, celery, carrot salad stick stained with low fat, Or replace the fruit you may eat potato chips or popcorn, This is not only
						to reduce the heat more than half, Fruits and vegetables in the rich vitamins and minerals can maintain normal physiological function. "Pick" helps the food of water metabolism, some people are not really fat, But the water retention, At this point
						should eat more water to exclude food, such as barley, watermelon, green beans, celery, black beans, melon, cucumber, grapes, Such foods have diuretic effect of edema, But some of the food cool, should be taken according to personal physical discretion.
					</p>
					<p>4. no later than 8 pm to eat Generally refers to some people at 8 pm more perseverance than 6 points do not eat For me, 8 points have been very accommodating (laughs) Reduced metabolic rate at night is the time when the body consumes the least calories
						So more than 8 points and eat supper are caused by obesity How to get rid of the bad habits of eating supper? There are things all right to find things to make yourself busy For example: watching TV, sports, playing computer and so on Good to eat
						dinner must eat dinner can not eat or it is easy to sleep Quit while watching TV while eating supper
					</p>
					<p>5. every meal will leave a third of the amount of food Food must not eat all light Eat a meal will chew a dozen times to swallow to increase satiety If the day has eaten a lot of people who can slowly reduce the weight of eating Otherwise a reduction
						of too much may cause physical discomfort Do not feel pity, waste to have to eat it And do not think about a little more food can put it all the idea of ​​eating light Unless you can know exactly how much you want to eat is not fat
					</p>
					<p>6. do not eat snacks Junk food nutritional value is not high but the heat is so high scary Eat and do not feel full of sense will eat too much and let the weight rise Watching TV while eating snacks accumulated calories but very scary If greedy want
						to eat, then it will be seaweed, chewing gum, cold days jelly solution greedy it
					</p>
					<p>7.Walk can also lose weight this is really yo !! At least 3 times a week for more than 20 minutes each time Must be a fast pace to go through a considerable distance in order to consume fat Consumption of about 1 kcal about 30 steps to consume 300
						kcal is at least a day walk more than 10,000 steps Do not exercise it does not matter to use to walk down it Walk to get off work, do not take the elevator to climb the stairs in life slowly accumulate raft can easily thin.
					</p>
					<p>8. measured body weight sooner or later Measure your weight daily to record yourself anytime, anywhere Rome is not a day caused by obesity is not today immediately blasting Night can be wary of their own supper will never eat tomorrow to eat less
						The weight of the show at any time to see the place like doing homework as measured every day Oh

					<p>9. keep standing and sitting Incorrect posture will make the weight loss effect greatly reduced Rise, chest, narrow belly to the upper body straight Buttocks can narrow the lower body Class or work to sit at any time to remind yourself to narrow
						the abdomen So the stomach will not be getting bigger Keep a good posture you can have a good body Oh
					</p>

					<p>10. bath, improve metabolism Before watching TV have shared the bath to lose weight is very suitable for lazy slim yo The average heat consumed by a hot bath for 30 minutes is equal to jogging 1000 meters If the water temperature is set at 42-43
						° C, the body will use more heat to consume more heat When the bath with a simple limb stretch and massage action Such as lifting the legs, or massage the arm, buttocks and waist And legs and other places can be thin so that the effect can be more
